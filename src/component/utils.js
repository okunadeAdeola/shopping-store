// // Your approach sounds good:

// // Landing Page (Product Listing): The first page where all products are displayed could be named something like ProductList or Shop. This page will fetch all the products from the backend and display them.

// // Product Details Page: When a user clicks on a product, they'll be directed to the ProductDetails page. Here, you can show more detailed information about the product, such as descriptions, price, images, etc.

// // Add to Cart & Login Check:

// // When the user clicks "Add to Cart" on the ProductDetails page, you'll first check if the user is logged in.
// // If the user is logged in, proceed to add the item to the cart.
// // If the user is not logged in, redirect them to the login page. After a successful login, they can be redirected back to the ProductDetails page, where they can complete the add-to-cart action.
// // This flow ensures a smooth user experience and secures the cart
